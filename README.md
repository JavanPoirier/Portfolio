# [Portfolio]

This was my first side project using React starting around April, 2018. I completed a fair portion of this portfolio using the skills I gathered on my work term. After getting to a presentable point I launched http://JavanPoirier.com. 

I have since been making changes and updated using new skills along the way. Refer to the changelog. Some of these included new additions using React Hooks, CSS3 features and more.
